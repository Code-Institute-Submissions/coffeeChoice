# Overview
For my final milestone project I have chosen to create an django ecommerce site for Nespresso coffee pods. Users 
will be able to purchase a wide range of Nespresso coffee capsules and have them delivered to their home address. 
The purchases are done via Stripe. Included on this site is also a coffee blog which users will be able to read posts on. Users can also leave comments for each individual blog post for other users of the site to see. Users can also leave coffee reviews for each individual coffee for other users of the site to see. 
All the media and static files I have stored using cloud storage by making use of Amazonâ€™s S3 service. 
Admin login for this site as as follows:
User:admin
password:password12345
The deployed site can be found here: https://coffechoice.herokuapp.com/

# UX
This website is designed for people who have nespresso coffee machines and want to purchase or find out 
information on coffee capsules which can be used in their machine. If a user has an opinion on a coffee capsule 
available on the site, they can choose to post a review in which they can express their opinion or if a user is 
curious about what a coffee is like, then they can read the reviews left by other users.
The site is also designed for people who are interested in developments in the nespresso coffee industry by 
allowing the site owner to post blog posts which users can leave comments under.
